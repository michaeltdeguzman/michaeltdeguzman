# An Interdisciplinary Review: Mathematics, Physics, Data Science, and Engineering

This project documents a 10-week self-directed study initiative that blends six core disciplines across STEM:

- **Applied Probability & Statistics** (Asimow & Maxwell)
- **Numerical Methods** (Burden & Faires)
- **Classical Mechanics & Electromagnetism** (Halliday & Resnick, Vols. 1 & 2)
- **Quantum Mechanics** (Griffiths)
- **Python Data Science & Machine Learning**
- **3D Engineering Design** (Autodesk Inventor)

---

### Goals

- To reinforce foundational theory across math and physics
- To apply concepts through coding, simulation, and modeling
- To build a professional portfolio of solved problems, visualizations, and reflections

---

### Deliverables

- Weekly logs and reflections
- Solved problem sets and summaries
- Code notebooks and simulation tools
- Design models and CAD exports
- A full [10-week PDF curriculum](link_here)

This interdisciplinary review bridges theory and application, preparing me for advanced work in quantum computing, actuarial modeling, and computational science.
