## üìö Overview

This week focused on foundational concepts in probability and mechanics:

- **Textbooks Referenced**:
  - Asimow & Maxwell, *Probability and Statistics with Applications* (Ch. 1‚Äì2)
  - Halliday & Resnick, *Fundamentals of Physics* Vol. 1 (Ch. 4)
  - Griffiths, *Introduction to Quantum Mechanics* (Ch. 1)

## üìò Concepts and Theorems

### **Probability & Combinatorics**

- **Addition Rule**:
  \[
  P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
  \]

- **Multiplication Rule** (Independent Events):
  \[
  P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
  \]

- **Permutations**:
  \[
  P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}
  \]

- **Combinations**:
  \[
  C(n, r) = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
  \]

### **Mechanics ‚Äì Newton‚Äôs Second Law**

From Halliday & Resnick, Ch. 4:
- **Newton‚Äôs Second Law**:
  \[
  \vec{F}_{\text{net}} = m \vec{a}
  \]

- **Free-body diagrams** were applied to inclined planes and frictional systems.

---

### **Quantum Foundations**

From Griffiths, Ch. 1:
- **Wavefunction Normalization**:
  \[
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
  \]

- Discussed basic interpretation of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) as probability density.

## üìù Problem Sets Attempted

- **Asimow & Maxwell**: 1.5, 1.8, 2.7  
- **Halliday & Resnick**: 4.8, 4.10  
- **Griffiths**: 1.1, 1.4

## ‚úçÔ∏è Reflection

Combinatorics helped build the foundation for understanding probability amplitudes in quantum mechanics.  
In physics, Newtonian systems laid the groundwork for later classical-to-quantum comparisons.  
I also practiced setting up free-body diagrams and solved initial projectile motion problems.  

This week helped tie together how logic and symmetry in counting relate to physical systems and quantum measurements.
