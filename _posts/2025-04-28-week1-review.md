### ðŸ§  Focus Areas
- **Probability** â€“ Counting rules, conditional probability (Asimow & Maxwell)
- **Physics** â€“ Newton's Laws, free-body diagrams (Halliday & Resnick)
- **Quantum Mechanics** â€“ Wave function & normalization (Griffiths)

---

### ðŸ“˜ Concepts Reviewed
- Inclusion-exclusion and permutations
- F = ma and net force analysis
- |Ïˆ(x)|Â² as probability density; âˆ«|Ïˆ(x)|Â² dx = 1

---

### âœ… Problems Attempted
- Asimow Ch. 1â€“2: #1.5, 1.8, 2.7
- Halliday Ch. 4: #4.8, 4.10
- Griffiths Ch. 1: #1.1, 1.4

---

### ðŸ“Œ Reflections
Each topic revealed connectionsâ€”classical intuition supports quantum mechanics, and probability theory underpins both quantum and statistical models.

Stay tuned for Week 2!
