## üìö Overview

This week focused on foundational concepts in probability and mechanics using:

- **Asimow & Maxwell** (Ch. 1‚Äì2)
- **Halliday & Resnick** Vol. 1 (Ch. 4)
- **Griffiths Quantum Mechanics** (Ch. 1)

## üìò Key Concepts

### Probability & Combinatorics

\[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
\]

\[
P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}, \quad C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
\]

### Newton‚Äôs Second Law (H&R, Ch. 4)

\[
\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = m \vec{a}
\]

Free-body diagrams helped visualize how forces add vectorially.

### Wavefunction Normalization (Griffiths Ch. 1)

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

## ‚úçÔ∏è Reflection

Combinatorics formed the foundation for quantum probability concepts.  
Classical physics built my intuition around forces and motion.  
Griffiths' wavefunction normalization linked math to measurement probabilities.
