## 📚 Weekly Focus

This week launched the interdisciplinary study with three foundational pillars:

- 📘 *Combinatorics & Probability* – Asimow & Maxwell, Ch. 1–2  
- ⚙️ *Classical Mechanics (Newton’s Laws)* – Halliday & Resnick, Vol. 1, Ch. 4  
- 🔬 *Quantum Wavefunctions & Normalization* – Griffiths, Ch. 1  

The goal was to establish mathematical and physical frameworks used across quantum theory, mechanics, and algorithmic modeling.

## 📘 Key Concepts & Formulas

### 🔹 Probability & Counting Principles

From Asimow & Maxwell, Chapters 1–2:

- **Addition Rule**  
  \[
  P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
  \]

- **Multiplication Rule (Independent Events)**  
  \[
  P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
  \]

- **Permutations and Combinations**  
  \[
  P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}, \quad C(n, r) = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
  \]

These ideas frame discrete probability and will carry forward into probabilistic quantum interpretations.

### 🔹 Newton’s Second Law of Motion

From Halliday & Resnick, Chapter 4:

- **Net Force and Acceleration**  
  \[
  \vec{F}_{\text{net}} = m \vec{a}
  \]

Applied to:
- Free-body diagrams
- Inclined plane problems
- Friction and tension systems

This review reinforced classical intuition that complements quantum force modeling at microscopic scales.

### 🔹 Wavefunction Normalization

From Griffiths, Chapter 1:

- **Born Interpretation of the Wavefunction**  
  \[
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
  \]

This integral ensures the wavefunction describes a complete probability distribution. It links beautifully back to the discrete rules introduced in combinatorics.

## ✍️ Weekly Reflection

Starting with discrete math and Newtonian mechanics was a deliberate choice — these domains feel grounded and intuitive. I appreciated how combinatorics led naturally into quantum probability via wavefunctions. Visualizing forces with free-body diagrams also helped me organize thinking spatially, which I suspect will be critical once we introduce Hamiltonians and system constraints.

The bridge between classical and quantum this week was subtle, but promising: from counting discrete outcomes, to summing force vectors, to integrating continuous probability densities.

Next week, I’ll dive into independent events and two-dimensional projectile motion, plus begin basic CAD design with Autodesk Inventor.
