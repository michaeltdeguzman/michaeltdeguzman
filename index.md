# Michael T. De Guzman  
### *Interdisciplinary Study Portfolio*

*This portfolio reflects my preparation for a comprehensive review of foundational topics and for post-graduate level research in support of applied technical roles in*  
**quantum systems design and modeling**, **algorithmic systems design**, and **advanced robotics**.

I hold a **Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics** from **UCLA** and a  
**Master of Science in Mathematics: Applied Mathematics** from **California State University, Long Beach (CSULB)**.

The work integrates core topics such as **optimization algorithms**, **photonic systems**,  
**robotics design**, **numerical modeling**, **scientific computing**, and **machine learning**.

It emphasizes hands-on tools and platforms including **Python**, **Jupyter Notebooks**,  
**Inventor CAD**, and rigorous techniques in **probabilistic modeling** and **classical mechanics**.
