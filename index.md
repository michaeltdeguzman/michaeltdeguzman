# Welcome to My Interdisciplinary Study Portfolio

Over the next 10 weeks, I’m challenging myself to integrate deep concepts across applied mathematics, physics, data science, and engineering design.

## 📘 Project Overview

This study includes:

- **Applied Math**: Review of Exam P-level probability and distributions
- **Numerical Methods**: Algorithms for root-finding, integration, and differential equations
- **Physics**: Classical mechanics and electromagnetism (Halliday & Resnick)
- **Quantum Mechanics**: Wave functions, operators, and spin systems (Griffiths)
- **Python Data Science**: NumPy, Pandas, visualization, and machine learning
- **3D CAD Design**: Autodesk Inventor modeling and constraint logic

I’ll share weekly:
- 📄 PDF summaries
- ✍️ Blog reflections
- 🧮 Solved problem sets
- 🛠️ Hands-on visual projects

## 📆 Week-by-Week Progress
(Coming soon…)
